# Embedded CTF Code


## Installing Dependencies

### Recommended Docker environment on Windows 10 (Required for Home edition) and MacOS:

* Download and install Docker Toolbox:
    - https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/
    - If system already has VirtualBox installed, uncheck box
    - If system already has Git installed, uncheck box

### Recommended Docker environment on Linux:

* Download and install "native" Docker
* Install VirtualBox to run Windows VM for PSoC Creator and Programmer software

### Alternative Docker environment on Windows 10 Pro and MacOS:
* Download and install VirtualBox
* Download and install Docker
    - When Docker launches it will tell you to enable Hyper-V, which in turn will disable VirtualBox.  
    - Do NOT enable Hyper-V
    - Note: by not enabling Hyper-V normal Docker usage will not work.  It will only work through Docker Machine

### Windows Environment Setup (Suggested):
* Download and install Cygwin
    - Search for ‘socat’ and ‘GNU make’ during installation
    - Click ‘Skip’ on these packages to show the version that will be installed
* Add Cygwin executables to the system PATH
    - Open ‘System Properties:Advanced’ and click ‘Evironment Variables’
    - Add Cygwin’s installation directory (typically ‘C:\cygwin64\bin’) to the front of the ‘Path’ system variable
    - Now all of the Cygwin Unix functions are available in all terminals
* Download and install Python
* (The following instructions assume that ‘make’, ‘socat’, and ‘python’ are available on the Path)

### Install PSoC Creator 4.1 (Requires Windows System)
* Download installer from http://www.cypress.com/products/psoc-creator-integrated-design-environment-ide
* Run installer and follow steps

### Use PSoC Creator 4.1 to program security_module
* Open ectf-workspace.cywrk
* Right-click the security_module project in the left pane and select set active project
* Plug-in MiniProg and PSoC
* Connect MiniProg to PSoC using 5-pin adapter
* Select Debug and Program

## Building and Running

The following interface is supported by the reference implementation and MUST
be supported by your implementation. The following commands apply to both the
atm\_backend and the bank\_server.

### Build the component image:

* *If no image exists, build image.*
* *If image exists, rebuild image.*
     - `(cd bank_server && make build)`
     - `(cd atm_backend && make build)`

### Start the component container:

* *If no container is running or stopped, create and start container.*
* *If container is stopped, start container*
* *If container is running, do nothing.*
     - `(cd bank_server && make start)`
     - `(cd atm_backend && make start)`

#### *note: your system must be persistent across start and stop.*

### Stop the component container:

* *If container is running, stop container*
* *If container is stopped, do nothing.*
     - `(cd bank_server && make stop)`
     - `(cd atm_backend && make stop)`

### Stop the component container and remove the component image:

* *If container is running, stop and remove container*
* *If container is stopped, remove container*
* *If container is does exist, do nothing*
     - `(cd bank_server && make clean)`
     - `(cd atm_backend && make clean)`

### Save logs from the component container:

* *If container is running, output logs*
* *If container is stopped, do nothing*
* *If container is does exist, do nothing*
     - `(cd bank_server && make logs)` // saved to /logs/*
     - `(cd atm_backend && make logs)` // saved to /logs/*

## Important Formatting Notes

### Format of Returned Values
| Value | Type/Size |
|-----------|------|
|Card ID | 36 ascii characters |
|HSM ID | 4 byte integer|
|Nonces| 32 bytes |
|PINs| 8 ascii characters |
|Balance Amount| 4 byte integer |
|Withdraw Amount | 4 byte integer |
|Encrypted Message| Length of data rounded up to the nearest multiple of 16 + a 16 byte authentication tag|

### Enum values used:
| Message Type | Value| Description |

|RETURN\_CARD\_SIGNATURE | 0x03 | Card responds with signature |
|REQUEST\_HSM\_NONCE | 0x04 | ATM asks HSM for nonce |
|RETURN\_HSM\_NONCE | 0x05 | HSM responds with nonce |
|REQUEST\_HSM\_UUID | 0x06 | ATM asks HSM for HSM ID |
|RETURN\_HSM\_UUID  | 0x07 | HSM sends its ID to ATM |
|REQUEST\_WITHDRAWAL | 0x08 | ATM asks HSM to decrypt message and return the bills if the message is valid |
|RETURN\_WITHDRAWAL | 0x09 | HSM sends bills to ATM |
|REQUEST\_BALANCE | 0x0A | ATM asks HSM to decrypt message and returns the balance if the message is valid |
|RETURN\_BALANCE | 0x0B | Returns the decrypted balance |
|REQUEST\_NEW_PK | 0x0C | ATM asks card to generate a new PK |
|RETURN\_NEW_PK | 0x0D | Card returns new PK |
