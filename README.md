# Embedded CTF Example Code

This repository contains an example reference system for MITRE's 2018 
[Embedded System CTF](http://mitrecyberacademy.org/competitions/embedded/).
This example meets all the requirements outlined in the challenge writeup
document, but is not implemented securely.  

## Disclaimer
This code is incomplete, insecure, and does not meet MITRE standards for
quality.  This code is being provided for educational purposes to serve as a
simple example that meets the minimum functional requirements for the 2018 MITRE
eCTF competition.  Use this code at your own risk!

## Updates 

### Fixed return types

This update fixes the type for the return value from `create_account` and `create_atm`. 
These functions previously returned string types, but the requirements state that the
functions must return an xmlrpclib.Binary type.  This update fixes the example code 
so that it is consistent with the requirements.

### Interface Additions

This update adds simple status functions to the admin interface and the atm 
provision interface.  These updates were needed to help simplify testing.
The rules document was also updated to reflect this change.

One new function was added to the admin interface:
* `ready_for_atm` returns `True` only when the bank is ready for ATM(s) to connect 
to its bank interface on port 1337. Use this functon to ensure that no ATM is 
started until the bank is ready to accept connections.

Three functions were added to the provision interface:
* `ready_for_hsm` returns `True` only when it is ready and waiting for an HSM to connect.
* `hsm_connected` returns `True` only after the HSM has connected and synced with the ATM 
  (it has been identified as an HSM).
* `card_connected` returns `True` only after a card has connected and synced with the ATM 
  (it has been identified as a card).


# Getting started

## Installing Dependencies

### Recommended Docker environment on Windows 10 (Required for Home edition) and MacOS:

* Download and install Docker Toolbox:
    - https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/
    - If system already has VirtualBox installed, uncheck box
    - If system already has Git installed, uncheck box

### Recommended Docker environment on Linux:

* Download and install "native" Docker
* Install VirtualBox to run Windows VM for PSoC Creator and Programmer software

### Alternative Docker environment on Windows 10 Pro and MacOS:
* Download and install VirtualBox
* Download and install Docker
    - When Docker launches it will tell you to enable Hyper-V, which in turn will disable VirtualBox.  
    - Do NOT enable Hyper-V
    - Note: by not enabling Hyper-V normal Docker usage will not work.  It will only work through Docker Machine

### Windows Environment Setup (Suggested):
* Download and install Cygwin
    - Search for ‘socat’ and ‘GNU make’ during installation
    - Click ‘Skip’ on these packages to show the version that will be installed
* Add Cygwin executables to the system PATH
    - Open ‘System Properties:Advanced’ and click ‘Evironment Variables’
    - Add Cygwin’s installation directory (typically ‘C:\cygwin64\bin’) to the front of the ‘Path’ system variable
    - Now all of the Cygwin Unix functions are available in all terminals
* Download and install Python
* (The following instructions assume that ‘make’, ‘socat’, and ‘python’ are available on the Path)

### Initializing Docker-Machine on all platforms:
* Open a terminal (‘Docker Quickstart Terminal’ for Windows or Mac)
* (If using Docker-Machine) Build a Docker container VM
     - Create a docker machine: `docker-machine create --driver virtualbox default`
     - Check that VM was created successfully: `docker-machine ls`
     - Find the IP address of the VM: `docker-machine ip`
     - If you ever need to administer the VM, you can ssh into the machine: `docker-machine ssh`
     - Enable USB in VirtualBox
          * Stop VM: `docker-machine stop default`
          * Use VirtualBox settings to enable USB
          * Start VM: `docker-machine start default`
* Build reference containers and start servers
     - Move into bank server directory: `cd bank_server`
     - Start the bank server and container: `make start`
	 - Move into ATM backend directory: `cd ../atm_backend`
     - Start the ATM backend server and container: `make start`

* Allow local interface code to connect to the servers running on the VM (requires redirection of network traffic)
     - `socat TCP-LISTEN:1336,fork,reuseaddr TCP:<IP address of VM>:1336 &`
     - `socat TCP-LISTEN:1338,fork,reuseaddr TCP:<IP address of VM>:1338 &`
* Verify connectivity to servers
     - Move to interface directory: `cd ../interfaces`
     - Start admin interface: `python admin_interface.py`
          * Type `create_atm testatm.info`
          * If successful, a long string of random characters will be returned and outputed to a file named testatm.info
          * Type `create_account testaccount 120 testaccount.info`
          * If successful, a long string of random characters will be returned and outputed to a file named testaccount.info
          * Type `exit`
     - Start provision interface: `python provision_interface.py`
          * Type `provision\_atm testatm.info test\_billfile`
          * If successful, True will be returned
          * Type `provision\_card testaccount.info '12345678'`
          * If successful, True will be returned
     - Start atm interface: ‘python atm_interface.py’
          * Type `check_balance '12345678'`
          * If successful, 120 will be returned
          * Type `withdraw'12345678' 10`
          * If successful, 10 bills will be returned
          * Type `change_pin '12345678' '87654321'`
          * If successful, True will be returned

### Install PSoC Creator 4.1 (Requires Windows System)
* Download installer from http://www.cypress.com/products/psoc-creator-integrated-design-environment-ide
* Run installer and follow steps

### Use PSoC Creator 4.1 to program security_module
* Open ectf-workspace.cywrk
* Right-click the security_module project in the left pane and select set active project
* Plug-in MiniProg and PSoC
* Connect MiniProg to PSoC using 5-pin adapter
* Select Debug and Program

## Building and Running

The following interface is supported by the reference implementation and MUST
be supported by your implementation. The following commands apply to both the
atm\_backend and the bank\_server.

### Build the component image:

* *If no image exists, build image.*
* *If image exists, rebuild image.*
     - `(cd bank_server && make build)`
     - `(cd atm_backend && make build)`

### Start the component container:

* *If no container is running or stopped, create and start container.*
* *If container is stopped, start container*
* *If container is running, do nothing.*
     - `(cd bank_server && make start)`
     - `(cd atm_backend && make start)`

#### *note: your system must be persistent across start and stop.*

### Stop the component container:

* *If container is running, stop container*
* *If container is stopped, do nothing.*
     - `(cd bank_server && make stop)`
     - `(cd atm_backend && make stop)`

### Stop the component container and remove the component image:

* *If container is running, stop and remove container*
* *If container is stopped, remove container*
* *If container is does exist, do nothing*
     - `(cd bank_server && make clean)`
     - `(cd atm_backend && make clean)`

### Save logs from the component container:

* *If container is running, output logs*
* *If container is stopped, do nothing*
* *If container is does exist, do nothing*
     - `(cd bank_server && make logs)` // saved to /logs/*
     - `(cd atm_backend && make logs)` // saved to /logs/*

## Other Examples

### Example 'socat' commmand to redirect TCP traffic
`socat TCP-LISTEN:1336,fork,reuseaddr TCP:192.168.99.100:1336 &`
`socat TCP-LISTEN:1338,fork,reuseaddr TCP:192.168.99.100:1338 &`
